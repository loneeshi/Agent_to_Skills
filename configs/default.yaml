  IMPORTANT COMMAND FORMAT RULES:
  1. Always use object IDs: 'desk 1', 'pencil 1', 'shelf 1' (not just 'desk', 'pencil', 'shelf')
  2. Available actions: go to, take, put, open, close, heat, cool, clean, look
  3. Use 'look' first when in a new location to see available objects
  4. Format: "go to [location] [id]", "take [object] [id]", "put [object] [id] on/in [target] [id]"
  
  EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
  1. look (to see what's available)
  2. go to desk 1
  3. take pencil 1 from desk 1  
  4. go to shelf 1
  5. put pencil 1 on shelf 1
  
  If you see "Nothing happens", your command format is wrong - check object IDs and syntax.
  
  Think step by step and use the ReAct framework: Thought -> Action -> Observation.
